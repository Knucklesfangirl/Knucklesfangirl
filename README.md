Hi besties !! <3 'w'

This is like something very new to me and I'm very stupid so don't expect much lols

Heres some stuff I like to do during my free time:

Draw - Read comics - Zone out - Make character designs - Watch videos - Sleep

I like seeing others happy, it makes me smile :)

Have a lovely day! (you can also visit my strawpage to see more about me if you'd like..) >w<

(Also, if you don't know my pronouns, feel free to ask in pt, I'm absolutely fine with people making accidents on those since I mean... I don't expect you to know them.)
