Hi friend !! <3 'w'

I still have to learn some stuff here heh-

Anyway, if you don't want to check out my strawpage (which is fine), here's a quick little "about me" thingy

-* - I am female, I enjoy drawing a ton and absolutely DESPISE coloring traditionally (I just think it ruins the drawing, but that's just me using the wrong colors hehe), I am horrible at explaining things, so please expect that if you want an explantion of something (or something close to that), conversations may end quickly if I don't know you, (wait now I'm just explaining other things!..)

AHEM! I like the color blue and purple combined, it's very pretty. Amy Rose is a character I use a lot as my persona, but I have since made a different version of her which I use to represent myself now. I can tend to be quite shy or nervous if approached in games (idk why and I really hate it) which might cause me to leave the game. I also tend to misspell things (such as that "explantion" on the text above this one) >_< - *-

Have a lovely day! (you can also visit my strawpage to see more about me if you'd like..) >w<

(Also, if you don't know my pronouns, feel free to ask in pt, I'm absolutely fine with people making accidents on those since I mean... I don't expect you to know them.)

vvvvvv ORR you can check down here! vvvvvv

Pronouns here !! : She/her - Other pronouns I'm ok with if I'm cosplaying as a different gendered character :>
